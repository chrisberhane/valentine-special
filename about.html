            <h1>Will You Be My Val?</h1>
            <p>Making or building this website wasn't the easiest thing for me but i am building it as some form of learning experience for me. I was not so sure of what i could do for you that was special on valentines day but i know that i promised to create a website for you. I am glad i am getting it done now. It should be ready before valentines day. I am not the most creative one out there but i try. Thank you for agreeing to be my val because i know i had already asked that before becuase i didn't want anyone to ask you that before i do over the distance. I love you this much.</p>
